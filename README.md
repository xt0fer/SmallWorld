# SmallWorld

## What is it? 

SmallWorld 2015 is a version of Smalltalk running on the Java virtual machine. 
In particular, it is a continuation of Prof. Tim Budd's SmallWorld, which was a port of his seminal Little Smalltalk to the JVM. 
I am not currently working on SmallWorld. 

## What is it not? 

It isn't a version of Smalltalk-80, nor is it compatible with the Smalltalk ANSI standard. Where it is incompatible with a Smalltalk-80 system (such as Squeak) SmallWorld follows its Little Smalltalk heritage - for example in the area of cascades (;) and the current lack of Symbols (eg #Something). 

## Who wrote it? 

It is a modified version of the original SmallWorld, which was written by A Prof. Tim Budd and can be found [here](http://web.engr.oregonstate.edu/~budd/SmallWorld/ReadMe.html). 
Many thanks must go to Tim, whose work with SmallWorld and before that his pioneering Little Smalltalk form by far the major part of this system, and who was kind enough to allow the release of SmallWorld under the MIT Licence. 

## How fast is it? 

Very very slow :) SmallWorld is a very simple bytecode interpreter running on top of a complicated and sophisticated JIT virtual machine (ie Java). Two levels of indirection from the hardware will introduce slowness. On the other hand, because its development environment is mostly handled by Java's Swing code, SmallWorld is fast enough to be pleasant to play with. 

## What has changed?

kyounger making changes.

### Version 2007.1 (January 2007)
